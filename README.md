# SammonMapping
A Java implementation for the Sammon Mapping algorithm
This is a Java implementation of the Sammon Mapping algorithm. The implementation has been ported
from the C# implementation written by GÃ¼nther M. FOIDL available at https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/43123/Sammon-Projection.
Sammon Mapping is a non linear technique to map a higher dimensional space into a lower dimensional space. It's main purpose
is to aid in visualization. It is useful for preliminary data analysis of all statistical pattern recognition as it provides a rough
visualization of the class distribution.[1]
